    "setDescription": "The GEM Smallcap Index is a new index that tracks the performance of decentralized financial assets on Uniswap. The investment focus is on small caps that have not yet been listed on Tier 1 Exchanges.


All tokens are checked and carefully researched based on a wide range of criteria. The aim is to make small investments in crypto projects with high potential in the early stages and thus to profit from a later performance after listing on a Tier 1 exchange. Nevertheless, the GEM Smallcap Index is a highly speculative asset.


The risk of investing in cryptocurrencies or crypto related assets can result in a complete loss. Investors should carefully consider an investment. The past performance is not indicative of future results.",
